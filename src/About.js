                    <h3>NFT Donut</h3>
                    <p>Hello, and welcome! After leaving my full time position as an electrical/software engineer in 2021, 
                        I was sucked into the rabbit hole of Web3... I was fascinated by blockchain technology and 
                        its massive potential! Initially, I was exploring the world of DeFi (particularly flash loans + 
                        exchange arbitrage), but as my desire 
                        to learn continued to grow, I ended up settling in the NFT space as an educator and project 
                        consultant. Now that I have a deeper understanding of the Web3 space, I'm doubling down on 
                        the software development side of things. I'm always looking to expand my network, so if you're 
                        interested in connecting with me for any reason, feel free to reach out!
                    </p>
